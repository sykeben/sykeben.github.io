            Your morning routine sets the tone for the day. My 8:30 AM lectures pushed me to build a simple but
            effective routine that keeps me productive and on track. If early mornings are a struggle, here's how mine
            helps - and why you might want to create your own.

            In a study performed by Roenneberg and their team in 2007, it was found that a relatively small amount of
            the population (around 15%) can be categorized under extreme/moderate Early chronotypes (<a
                href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2007.07.005" target="_blank">source</a>). While such individuals
            may be more likely to accrue sleep-debt during the work week, there is a significant tradeoff: Their
            circadian rhythms fall in line with standard working hours. I am one of these individuals, and I believe
            that my morning routine is a key promoter of such a sleep schedule.

            Due to some scheduling issues, I have a lecture scheduled for 8:30 AM every morning. As seen in Roenneberg's
            study, a schedule like this would not align with the circadian rhythms of a majority of people. And,
            initially, it did not align with mine, either.

            However, that changed when I began implementing a rather lax morning routine.

            helps me exercise my brain and gets me thinking.

            After I down my digital digest, I get out of bed and head down the hall to my dorm's bathroom for some
            personal hygiene. This may somewhat basic, but I felt that I should mention it because it's important that
            we all maintain our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            While some portions of your individual morning hygiene routine may be somewhat time-consuming, it's worth
            planning around this to ensure that you are taking care of yourself. For example: It doesn't matter if you
            brush before or after eating breakfast, it's important that you just get it done to prevent a slew of health
            issues.
        </p>

        <div class="row row-cols-1 g-2 g-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-3">

            I then return to my room to get dressed, pack my bag, and head to the dining courts for the last part of my
            routine: Breakfast, which presents another common divide among people: Whether or not we eat it.
        </p>
        <p>
            While personal preferences and opinions on breakfast-eating may vary, research presented by Adolphus and
            their team help to shed light on some of its benefits. Adolphus' results show that eating breakfast may have
            a positive effect on individuals but reasoning behind such effects can range from it providing structure to
            reducing disruptive behaviors (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00425"

            Similar to a building, I believe every day needs a strong base to build on in order to be end up being a
            successful one. And, for me, that base is my morning routine. As a college student, my daily schedule varies
            quite a bit throughout the week. Stresses and tasks come and go, but there is one constant I can rely on: My
            mornings. By setting up a routine to help start my day, I can give myself some basic structure.
