            After several years of using the same simple, static website, I realized it was high time for a
            change. My website, SykeBen, showcases my work as an electrical engineer, software developer, and
            photographer, but it was in dire need of an overhaul to reflect my personal growth and evolving
            skill-set. In this inaugural article, I'll take you behind the curtain of this whole website
            redesign, discussing the various challenges, goals, and technologies I used to make SykeBen faster,
            more interactive, and visually appealing.

                target="_blank"><code>archive/old-master</code></a> tag in the source tree, the old website was "fine"
            by most respects, but it's development had stagnated. Keep in mind, I had written the overwhelming majority
            of the original website while still attending high school. But it has been almost four years since I've
            graduated, so it was time for a change.

        <!-- ChatGPT's Thoughts -->
        <p>
            I may be qualified enough to review my own code, but I wanted an honest opinion on the previous state of the
            website, so I defaulted to everyone's favorite new tool: <em class="definition"
                title="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</em>. I spun up a new instance, making sure to fill the model in on
            what I was up to, and asked it to review the source code for the old homepage...

                    "The old SykeBen homepage had a solid structure but relied heavily on static content and legacy
                    frameworks. The Bootstrap 4-based design ensured a responsive layout, but the use of multiple
                    external CSS libraries, jQuery, and animated effects resulted in some performance overhead. While
                    the site had a visually appealing card-based navigation system and clear branding, there was room
                    for improvement in code maintainability and efficiency. For example, reducing dependencies on
                    external scripts, modernizing animations with CSS instead of JS, and implementing a more modular
                    JavaScript approach would have streamlined performance."

        <!-- My Response -->
        <p>
            Honestly, it was totally right. While there was a solid structure here, the original website had <em>a
                lot</em> going on. There were a lot of external references present which really increased the load time
            on slower networks (which I noticed during development on the school WiFi), not to mention my obsession with
            animating practically everything I could. Don't get me wrong, it looked <em>great</em>, but it was a little
            much as I strung these animations together to the point where some sequences reached almost 10 seconds in
            length. And, as it mentioned, this did end up inhibiting my ability to maintain the code to the point where
            I just gave up and redid the whole thing.

        <!-- My Opinion -->
        <p>
            I had put off the redesign for the first few years of college as I didn't think I had enough time to tackle
            it outside classes. But I decided to bite the bullet after meeting with our galleries director to discuss
            possible outlets for my photographic work as they suggested I put up a portfolio to better showcase my
            creations, which I thought was a great idea. In the end, the whole ordeal only took a week in between
            classes and homework, invalidating the original reasoning I had for not taking care of it.

            For the sake of being thorough, I ran the new homepage's source code through the same review process in
            comparison to its original release and here's what I got back...

                    "The new SykeBen homepage isn't just a redesign, it's a transformation. What was once a static and
                    functional space has evolved into a dynamic, interactive experience. The minimal yet bold hero
                    section, complete with an animated cursor, sets the tone for a modern and engaging interface. The
                    structured content cards make navigation effortless, and the refined typography enhances
                    readability. With a clean layout, subtle animations, and a modernized structure, the site now
                    reflects both technical expertise and creative expression. This redesign not only improves
                    aesthetics but also reinforces the identity of SykeBen as a hub for innovation, engineering, and

            While I don't like tooting my own horn, I'd have to agree with it once again. <em>I had something I could be
                proud of again</em> that more accurately reflected my skills and personality as an electrical engineer,
            developer, and photographer. I'm really happy with my decision to overhaul it as it has shown me the true
            scope of how much my skills as a developer have improved over the last few years.

        <!-- ChatGPT Reasoning -->
        <p>
            While I could have consulted professional web designers during the whole process, I wanted to be able to get
            honest opinions and suggestions on what I could add to the site. So, once again, I turned to ChatGPT for
            assistance. <em>"If it's good enough to sanity-check my homework solution processes and catch errors, why
                shouldn't I use it to scaffold my new website,"</em> I thought. And I believe I thought right.

        <!-- Prompting and Guidelines -->
        <p>
            Of course, as with any other literary or analytical work, <em>I made a point to prompt the model's responses
                to be restrained to those an assistant or editor may provide</em>. This is actually the same process I
            employ when using ChatGPT to complete homework assignments (outside of literally telling it to act like a
            TA) as it prevents me from developing a reliance on its provided responses and ensures I actually learn or
            create the content under my own power.

            I'm really happy with how everything turned out here. I believe that redoing my website, as an exercise and
            a side-project, allowed me to better reflect on the major improvements in my skill-set that I may have not
            noticed before. It also allowed me to experiment with an ethical use for <span class="definition"
                title="Large Language Models">LLMs</span> like ChatGPT in the process of rapid prototyping and content
            creation, a topic I'll be covering in my next blog post.
