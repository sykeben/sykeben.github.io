            <i class="bi bi-person"></i> About Me
        </h2>
        <p class="text-indent">
            I'm an electrical engineer with a knack for solving problems, introducing new technology, and
            continuously learning from the world around me. From a young age, I've been enthralled in the way things
            work and how we can always improve them. What excites me most about electrical engineering is the feeling I
            get from being able to make a real-world impact, whether it's optimizing an industrial process or developing
            a new idea.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            I believe that the combination of technical knowledge with human creativity is an immensely powerful tool
            that allows us to approach challenges from different angles. Whether I'm designing control systems or
            experimenting with code for a personal project, I genuinely enjoy connecting the dots between ideas and
            their practical applications. In my eyes: Engineering is not just about making things; it's about making
            things that matter, things that push boundaries and improve the lives of everyday people.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Approach -->
    <section class="container mt-3">
        <h2 class="text-center text-shadow">
            <i class="bi bi-search"></i> My Approach
        </h2>
        <p class="text-indent">
            My approach to engineering and problem-solving revolves around my aforementioned combination of knowledge
            with creativity, alongside principles of collaboration and persistence. I believe that every new challenge
            presents an opportunity for me to learn and grow. When I encounter a problem, my first instinct is to pull
            it apart, find what makes it tick, and innovate it out of the way.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            I am also a firm believer in the power of collaboration with everyday people. The best solutions to a
            problem can often come from a wide array of diverse perspectives, and by working alongside people who are
            passionate, driven, and unafraid to share their ideas, we can all thrive as a collective group. By
            exchanging knowledge and expertise, we can create better-engineered, more effective solutions that achieve
            something much greater than what any one person could do alone.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            Ultimately, my personal and professional work is driven by a desire to contribute to something in the bigger
            scheme of it all. Whether I'm developing a new product, being mentored by (or mentoring) others, or
            improving systems, I strive to leave a positive impact on everything I touch.

        <h2 class="text-center text-shadow">
            <i class="bi bi-bookmark-heart"></i> My Passions
        </h2>
        <p class="text-indent">
            As an engineer, I am passionate about utilizing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and
            good old automation to solve real-world problems. I'm always excited to explore how these trending concepts
            can be applied to improve processes, predict upcoming results, and possibly even help prevent critical
            errors before they happen.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            I also have a deep interest in exercising sustainable engineering practices. With the world facing
            significant environmental and resource challenges, I've got an eye on new ways to explore how we can use
            innovation to create more efficient, environmentally-friendly solutions that can have a positive impact on
            both industry and our planet.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            Outside of traditional engineering, I've always enjoyed tinkering with electronics and putting together side
            projects, whether it's a new device, piece of software, or a complex automation system. These personal
            projects allow me to solve life problems by testing new ideas, exploring new technologies, and staying
            curious, no matter where the world takes me.

        <h2 class="text-center text-shadow">
            <i class="bi bi-clock-history"></i> My Vision
        </h2>
        <p class="text-indent">
            As I continue to grow as an engineer and as a person, I'm eager to explore new frontiers in manufacturing
            robotics, and automation. My goal is to eventually lead innovative projects that not only improve the
            overall efficiency of industries but also contribute to a more sustainable future that we can be excited to
            live in. I'm excited about the opportunity to work on projects that challenge my personal creativity and
            push my technical abilities to new limits.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            In the long run, I aspire to take on intimate leadership roles where I can mentor the next generation of
            engineers and be part of the teams that create truly life-changing solutions. Whether it's within a large
            company or through a tight-knight startup venture, I hope to collaborate with all manner of diverse minds to
            bring big ideas to life.
